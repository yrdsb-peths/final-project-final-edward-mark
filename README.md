This is Animal Merge, Mark and Edward's final project. 
The game that we designed is a animal merging game, where players will try to achieve bigger and better animals through merging animals of the same type.

The order of the animals is as follows:
Rabbit → Chicken → Cat → Dog → Pig → Sheep → Cow → Wolf → Tiger 

The main objective in the game is for the player to achieve four tigers, which then the player can either choose to start a new game or to continue that same run to achieve a new high score. 

To play the game, all the player has to do is to choose between 4 columns to drop the random animal (rabbit, chicken, cat or dog) using left, right arrow keys and the space key. There is also a guide that summarizes controls and merging orders which players can access from the title screen by pressing the key "G"
